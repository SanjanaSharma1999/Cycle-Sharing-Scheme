# Cycle-Sharing-Scheme
The cycle sharing scheme provides means for the people of the city to commute  using a convenient, cheap, and green transportation alternative. The service has 500  bikes at 50 stations across Seattle. Each of the stations has a dock locking system (where  all bikes are parked); kiosks (so customers can get a membership key or pay for a trip);  and a helmet rental service. A person can choose between purchasing a membership  key or short-term pass. A membership key entitles an annual membership, and the key  can be obtained from a kiosk. Advantages for members include quick retrieval of bikes  and unlimited 45-minute rentals. Short-term passes offer access to bikes for a 24-hour  or 3-day time interval. Riders can avail and return the bikes at any of the 50 stations  citywide
